# Replication package

## About

This repo contains a replication package for the extraction and synthesis of data used for the literature review in our thesis called *Whoâ€™s Really Coding? The Rise of AI and Its Impact on Developer Agency*. 

### data-extraction

The data extraction table includes a list of all the articles that were found during our database search. Each article has been given an ID, next to the basic information of an article (title, publishing year, link, abstract, keywords).

For each article we have also a checklist for our criteria used for inclusion and exclusion. The column to the right of this marks an article as "Exclude" or "Include" based on the criteria. For an article to be included, it has to fill all of the criteria for inclusion (IC01-IC-05) and have none of the exclusion boxes checked to the right (EC01-EC05).

The raw findings that we have picked out from every article is then grouped under our three research questions (RQ1-RQ3). Since we were going to conduct a survey based on these findings, ideas for questions to respondents can be seen to the right.

### data-synthesis

The data synthesis table is our grouping of similar findings synthesized under a common statement. The findings are are given an ID (F01-F32) and are grouped based on what research question we think it is related to. The synthesized findings are also grouped under a common theme. For instance, F01 is related to RQ1 and is listed under Advantages related to Productivity.

Each synthesized finding also contains the list of raw findings it is based on. The Articles column to the very right is referring to the article ID used previously in the data extraction table.

Finally, a list of discarded findings is a couple of findings that upon further discussion and analysis were found to be irrelevant to our thesis.
